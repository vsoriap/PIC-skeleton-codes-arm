This program contains sample codes for illustrating the basic structure
of a 3D Electromagnetic Vector Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, in both
Fortran and C.  The codes have no diagnosics except for initial and
final energies.  Their primary purpose is to provide example codes for
physical science students learning about Vector PIC codes.  They are
also intended as benchmark reference codes to aid in developing new
codes and in evaluating new computer architectures and compilers.

PIC codes are widely used in plasma physics.  They model plasmas as
particles which interact self-consistently via the electromagnetic
fields they themselves produce.  PIC codes generally have three
important procedures in the main iteration loop.  The first is the
deposit, where some particle quantity, such as a charge, is accumulated
on a grid via interpolation to produce a source density.  The second
important procedure is the field solver, which solves Maxwell’s equation
or a subset to obtain the electric and/or magnetic fields from the
source densities.  Finally, once the fields are obtained, the particle
forces are found by interpolation from the grid, and the particle
co-ordinates are updated, using Newton’s second law and the Lorentz
force.  The particle processing parts dominate over the field solving
parts in a typical PIC application. 

More details about PIC codes can be found in the texts by C. K. Birdsall
and A. B. Langdon, Plasma Physics via Computer Simulation, 1985,
R. W. Hockney and J. W. Eastwood, Computer Simulation Using Particles,
1981, and John M. Dawson, "Particle simulation of plasmas", Rev. Mod.
Phys. 55, 403 (1983).  Details about the mathematical equations and
units used in this code is given in the companion article,
"Description of Electromagnetic Spectral Code from the UPIC Framework"
by Viktor K. Decyk, UCLA, in the file EMModels.pdf.

The code here uses the complete electromagnetic interaction, obtained by
solving Maxwell's equation.  A spectral method using Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) is used to solve the Maxwell and Poisson equations.  A
real to complex FFT is used, and the data in Fourier space is stored in
a packed format, where the input and output sizes are the same.  The
boundary conditions are periodic, only electron species are included,
and linear interpolation is used.

Vectorization today is largely based on exploiting Single Instruction
Multiple Data (SIMD) processors that can perform the same instruction
on multiple data items.  The one we are focussing on here is the Intel
PHI Coprocessor Knight's Corner (KNC) Many Integrated Core (MIC).  Two
approaches are used for vectorization.  The simplest is to use
vectorization tools that will analyze and compile Fortran and C/C++
codes to run on the SIMD processors.  Alternatively, Intel also provides
vector intrinsincs, which are assembly-coded functions that allow direct
access to vector assembly language instructions in C/C++.  Compiler
vectorization is normally implemented from loops.  Vector instrinics are
implemented as a vector language. Further details about Intel compiler
vectorization can be found at:

and at https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/.

Both vectorization approaches are illustrated in this Skeleton code.
One version uses the KNC MIC vector instrinsics.  Two libraries,
avx512lib3.c and kncbpush3.c, implement the functionality of the serial
bpush3.c file in the bpic3 directory.  This is very low level
programming and difficult to understand, but gives the best performance.
The second version made use of compiler directives.  Two libraries,
vbpush3.f and vbpush3.c, reimplemented the serial bpush3.f and bpush3.c
files in such a way that the compiler could automatically vectorize the
loops.  Details of about this process for this code are described in the
file VectorPIC3.pdf.  A parameter kvec in the main codes selects which
version will run.

Particles are initialized with a uniform distribution in space and a
gaussian distribution in velocity space.  This describes a plasma in
thermal equilibrium.  The inner loop contains a current and charge
deposit, add guard cell procedures, a vector and scalar FFT, a
transverse current procedure, Maxwell and Poisson solvers, vector FFTs,
copy guard cell procedures, a particle push, and a particle sorting
procedure.  The final energy and timings are printed.  A sample output
file for the default input parameters is included in the file output.

In more detail, the inner loop of the code contains the following

   DSORTP3YZLT (cdsortp3yzlt) or ckncdsortp3yzlt: sort particles by cell

The inputs to the code are the grid parameters indx, indy, indz, the
particle number parameters npx, npy, npz, the time parameters tend, dt,
and the velocity paramters vtx, vty, vtz, vx0, vy0, vz0, the inverse
speed of light ci, the flag relativity, the sorting parameter sortime,
and the version selector kvec.

In more detail:
indx = exponent which determines length in x direction, nx=2**indx.
indy = exponent which determines length in y direction, ny=2**indy.
indz = exponent which determines length in z direction, nz=2**indz.
   These ensure the system lengths are a power of 2.
npx = number of electrons distributed in x direction.
npy = number of electrons distributed in y direction.
npz = number of electrons distributed in z direction.
   The total number of particles in the simulation is npx*npy*npz.
tend = time at end of simulation, in units of plasma frequency.
dt = time interval between successive calculations.
   The number of time steps the code runs is given by tend/dt.
   dt should be less than .45*ci for the electromagnetic code.
vtx/vty/vtz = thermal velocity of electrons in x/y/z direction.
   a typical value is 1.0.
vx0/vy0/vz0 = drift velocity of electrons in x/y/z direction.
ci = reciprocal of velocity of light
relativity = (no,yes) = (0,1) = relativity is used
sortime = number of time steps between electron sorting.
   This is used to improve cache performance.  sortime=0 to suppress.
kvec = (1,2) = run (autovector,KNC) version

Files with the suffix.f90 adhere to the Fortran 90 standard, files with
the suffix .f adhere to the Fortran77 standard, files with the suffix
.f03 adhere to the Fortran2003 standard, and files with the suffix .c
and .h adhere to the C99 standard.

The makefile is setup to use icc and ifort with Linux.  Definitions for
other compilers are in the Makefile, but are commented out.  

Three executables can be created, fvbpic3 for Fortran90, f03vbpic3 for
Fortran2003, and cvbpic3 for C.  The only differences between the
Fortran90 and Fortran2003 codes is how the interface to C is handled.
Interoperability with C is part of Fortran2003, but is still unfamiliar
to many programmers.

To compile program for execution in native mode, execute:

Make program_name

where program_name is either: fvbpic3, f03vbpic3 or cvbpic3.

To create all of them, execute:

make

To execute, first copy the executable to the Coprocessor:

scp program_name your_userid_id@mic0:program_name

then ssh to the Coprocessors and type the name of the executable:

ssh mic0
./program_name

where program_name is either fvbpic3, f03vbpic3 or cvbpic3

The file output contains the results produced for the default parameters
The file output.knc contains result for the KNC version.

The Fortran versions can be compiled to run with double precision by
changing the Makefile (typically by setting the compiler options flags
-r8), but only when the runtime parameter kvec = 1.

The library vbpush3.c contains wrapper functions to allow the C library
to be called from Fortran. The library vbpush3_f.c contains wrapper
functions to allow the Fortran library to be called from C.
